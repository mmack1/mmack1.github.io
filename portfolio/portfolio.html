            <h1>Cancer Tech-Networks</h1>
            <p><strong>January 2017 - January 2020</strong></p>
            <p>The "Cancer Tech-networks" project explores how disruptions in normal cell cycles can lead to cancer, utilizing public gene expression data, bioinformatics tools, and computational techniques. 
              By analyzing gene and protein networks from databases, the research identifies factors contributing to cancer and seeks to pinpoint specific behaviors in the most common cancers. 
              The project also investigates potential new treatments for lung cancer, with a particular focus on the effects of curcumin, a natural compound, in combating cancer cell proliferation.

            <h1>Cancer Tech-Networks</h1>
            <p> The goal of this project was to examine some of the factors responsible for disrupting normal cell cycles. 
              Given the complexity of cancer and common misconceptions about biological processes, the project integrates 
              bioinformatics tools and computational techniques to analyze public gene expression data from the NCBI database.
               In this project I learned to use DAVID and STRING to map interactions between genes involved in common cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon/rectal, and lung cancer. 
               The project was an effort to use a network-based perspective on how mutations in genes and proteins can drive the development of cancer.
              The research also addresses the challenges of identifying which genes are most involved in cancer progression, by analyzing gene and protein networks. 
              This project was my first introduction to Bioinformatics. I placed 3rd in the Texas State Science Fair for this project in 2018.

            <h1>Edgar Allen Poe Poetry Generator</h1>
            <p><strong>August 2020 - May 2024</strong></p>
            <p>The Edgar Allan Poe-try Generator is a project that applies generative modeling techniques to create poems in the style of Edgar Allan Poe. 
              It uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 language model to generate poetry based on a corpus of Edgar Allan Poe’s works, focusing on structured prediction learning. 
              The goal was to replicate and expand upon a prior research paper to produce coherent, creative poems in the iconic style of Poe.

            <h1>Edgar Allen Poe Poetry Generator</h1>
            <p> This project leverages modern generative modeling to create poems in the distinct style of Edgar Allan Poe. 
              Drawing inspiration from the "GPoeT-2: A GPT-2 Based Poem Generator" research paper, the project used a pre-trained GPT-2 model
               and customized it with additional layers to generate poetry in the specific language and thematic style of Edgar Allan Poe. 
               The dataset for training the model was a collection of Edgar Allan Poe’s poetic works, differing from the original paper's use of limericks.
                We struggled due to computation limitations of fine-tuning a large pre-trained model. We had redesign parts of the model, especially in the generation process.
               Although the model was able to generate some poetic outputs, it struggled to maintain consistent coherence and quality, often producing repetitive or 
               disjointed text. Despite these challenges, the project met its baseline goal of producing outputs 
               better than random generation, though it fell short of consistently creating coherent poems with a recognizable rhyme 
               scheme.

            <h1>Affirmative Action Study</h1>
            <p>This project investigates how affirmative action policies impact racial demographics in higher education utilizing data from the U.S.
               Department of Education, focusing on enrollment statistics from 1980 to 2021. 
               Conclusions were made using hypothesis testing and machine learning models like KNN and Logistic Regression to explore correlations between race-conscious admissions policies and student demographics at public universities.</p>

          <div class="info">
            <h1>Affirmative Action Study</h1>
            <p>The project utilized a rich dataset spanning over 40 years, sourced from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), to investigate the racial and ethnic demographics of students enrolled in U.S. public universities. 
              The data spans from 1980 to 2021 and includes over 3.5 million rows from institutions across the nation. 
              This dataset, stored in the file "ipeds_joined.db", contains 20 demographic columns detailing the enrollment by race, ethnicity, and other attributes. 
              IPEDS data is curated and managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), a part of the U.S. Department of Education, and is considered a highly reputable 
              and authoritative source of information on higher education.
              The dataset had to be meticulously cleaned and standardized, especially considering the challenges that arose from 
              inconsistent labeling and category changes over the years. For example, categories for race and ethnicity were not always uniform 
              across years, with certain groups being combined or split over time. 
              To address these discrepancies, I manually standardized the labels across all years, ensuring consistent categorization. 
              The cleaning process also involved handling duplicates resulting from multiple surveys within the same year for the same institution. 
              This was handled by performing aggregation queries, summing demographic data for each institution per year. 
              Given the political significance of affirmative action, the project aimed to examine how these policies
              have affected the racial composition of students at public universities in states where affirmative action was banned compared
              to states that still used it prior to its repeal. Conclusions were made using hypothesis testing and machine learning models 
              like KNN and Logistic Regression to explore correlations between race-conscious admissions policies and student demographics at public universities.
              This project could be examined to include more recent developments since June 2023. However, data on this is still being collected.

            <h1>Arduino Powered Escape Room</h1>
            <p> I led the design and development of an immersive escape room, centered around the theme of the Minoan civilization. 
              The project required a blend of creativity and technical expertise, as we crafted a storyline and set that tied together 
              the various puzzles and challenges. I was responsible for not only conceptualizing and coding the four interactive games 
              within the escape room. 
              The escape room featured a variety of technological game elements seamlessly integrated into the environment and decorations, 
              bringing the Minoan theme to life. For the puzzles, I programmed sensors using Arduino in C++ to detect variables such as temperature
               and water levels, creating a dynamic and responsive environment. We integrated live feedback buttons to provide players with real-time 
               interactions, enhancing the immersion. Additionally, I used CAD modeling and 3D printing techniques to design and construct custom game 
               pieces and props, ensuring they were both functional and aligned with the Minoan theme.
              The room’s control systems were powered by Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards, with displays for time tracking 
              and audio feedback to guide players throughout their journey. The combination of hardware, software, and design elements 
              made this project a unique challenge, and I took pride in bringing everything together into a cohesive and engaging experience. This hands-on project not only strengthened my skills in CAD modeling, Arduino programming, and interactive design but also allowed me to develop my teamwork abilities as we coordinated our unique skills to make this come to life.

        <h1>Strangers in the System: Legality and Labor in Immigrant Experiences</h1>
        <p> Strangers in the System critically examines the racialized dynamics of immigration, focusing on the intersections of legal status and class in shaping immigrant experiences. The project investigates how the categorization of individuals as "legal" or "illegal" immigrants plays a pivotal role in framing societal perceptions of race, labor, and productivity. By analyzing both legal discourse and everyday language, the research highlights the role of racialized narratives in shaping the social, economic, and political outcomes of immigrants, with a particular focus on their access to labor markets, economic stability, and social rights. This project offers a deeper understanding of how legal and racial boundaries contribute to the marginalization and exploitation of immigrant populations, shedding light on the complex ways that class, productivity, and language intersect to define who belongs and who does not in society.

      <h1>Restaurant Operations Simulation</h1>
      <p> This project models the complex flow of a sit-down restaurant, 
        simulating customer seating, order processing, and kitchen queue management.
         The goal of this project was to optimize restaurant operations by analyzing 
         factors such as table assignment, order prioritization, and staff efficiency. 
         The model simulated a typical customer experience from arrival to order fulfillment
          as well as a back of house model dictates staff allocation and a priority queue for
           the kitchen. This model was created using the programming language Forge.  
           Making good abstraction choices to balance efficiency while still feeling realistic. 
           Forge (like Alloy) doesn’t have a native queue data structure or explicit time progression,
            so we need to simulate priority order using relations and constraints. 
            Since Forge lacks traditional looping constructs, we can model a priority 
            queue in a relational and staged manner, leveraging ordering constraints by
             assigning each dish a priority value. These dishes were inserted into the
              queue using a doubly linked list. Since Forge is relation-based rather than
               imperative, the linked lists model used binary relations instead of pointers. 
               Each customer was seated based on party size and table availability (no wait time
                estimates were modeled). Each order was randomized based on a simple menu with four dishes. Unfortunately the model was not able to simulate sequential cooking. Since Forge doesn’t have traditional multithreading or explicit concurrency control,
                 the model did not simulate sequential cooking. In the future this could be handled by assigning a dish to one station at a time where multiple stations allow for simultaneous cooking. The biggest challenge in this model was accurately 
                 tracking orders to the right customers and tables once they entered the kitchen, especially with the stage-by-stage setup and the constant turnover of tables. Instead of continuous time, the sequence of discrete stages were used to represent key events in the restaurant flow.
