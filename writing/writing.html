          <h2>Current and Future Projects</h2>
          <p>AI-Powered Accessibility Tool: I'm working on improving a screen reader project that I designed
            in 2022 for visually impaired individuals and people with learning or neurodevelopmental disabilities. 
            I want to improve and application navigation by integrating machine learning and computer vision.
            I hope this tool could evolve into an app that leverages voice recognition and text-to-speech technology 
            to make digital spaces more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
            <p>Interactive Air Quality Monitor:

            Inspired by the concept of a Tamagotchi for air quality, 
            I am working on a project explores creating a device that tracks environmental conditions 
            in a room using hardware sensors. By integrating components like the PMS5003
            for particulate matter and the BME680 for temperature, humidity, and air quality,
            the goal is to provide real-time feedback in an engaging, interactive way. Alternatively, 
            I have been considering an app-based version that could analyze local environmental conditions
            using data from weather APIs like OpenWeatherMap or AirVisual. Both focus
            on making air quality awareness more accessible and engaging through intuitive design and 
            potential gamification elements.</p>
            <p> I want to make significant adjustments to this website to make it more user-friendly, accessible, and adaptable to other devices. 
              Right now, it feels a bit disconnected from page to page, and I’d like to create a fully scrollable experience that flows seamlessly.
              It should be responsive, ensuring it adapts well to different screen sizes, including phones and tablets. Performance is another major concern—
              I’ve noticed some lag in certain elements, and the site doesn’t load as fast as I’d like. Optimizing for speed is a priority, whether that means reducing render-blocking resources, improving data fetching efficiency, or leveraging caching strategies.
              Additionally, the overall design could be more visually appealing and cohesive. I want to refine the aesthetic to create a polished, 
              modern look that enhances readability and engagement. To improve performance and scalability,
              I plan to integrate a proxy server like Node.js. This would help with efficient data handling, reduce latency, and provide more flexibility in managing API requests. By making these updates, I aim to create a smooth, high-performing website that feels immersive and intuitive for users.

              Becoming a published author: It has been my lifelong dream to write a book and I would love to adapt my senior 
              undergraduate thesis into a coherent book detailing the impact that AI/ML has on 
              security and other measures when examining Immigration.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>I currently work as an independent contractor, specializing in training AI
            and ML models with a focus on generative AI. My role involves tailoring solutions 
            to customer specifications, cleaning data, generating new datasets, and updating models. 
            During my undergraduate studies, I held various positions, including wellness peer educator, where I helped coordinate and execute programs 
            that encouraged students to explore what it means to be healthy. I also spent a lot of time as a 
            Teaching Assistant, working with high school and college students. I have a passion for helping others and
            thrive in collaborative environments.</p>
            <p>I also love working as a volunteer and have worked 
              with a variety of organizations including Soujourner House, 
              Brown University BWell, RI Board of Elections and the Swearer Center.
